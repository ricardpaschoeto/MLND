# Project 01 - Pricing Boston Real Estate Prices

In this project, you will evaluate the performance and estimation power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from real estate in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model prepared for such data and seen as well adjusted may then be used for certain estimates about a property - in particular, its monetary value. This model would be of great value to someone as a furniture agent, who could make use of this information daily.

# Project 02 - Building a Student Intervention System

The goal of this project is to identify students who may need early intervention before being disapproved

# Project 03 - Creating Customer Segments

In this project we will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

# Capstone - System to predict stock prices

* pandas_datareader
* arch_model

This project came from my interest in the financial market and the technical characteristics linked to the movements of assets (stocks). I have developed an application that will predict stock prices in a range of dates or on a specific date chosen for Brazilian stock market shares. The data used for analysis comes from historical data obtained by the system from specific providers for the collection of information via Phyton (eg yahoo, Google finance, and others) for each share. The user interacts with the system through a web application.

* System to predict stock prices

Include the '.SA' prefix before start the seaching:

p. ex.: PETR4.SA, ABEV3.SA

* Server Initialize:

Navigate until 'manage.py'
