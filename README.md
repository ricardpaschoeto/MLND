# Project 01 - Pricing Boston Real Estate Prices

In this project your task is to build an optimal machine learning model to estimate the best selling price for your clientâ€™s home in the Boston metropolitan area based on a statistical analysis of the historical data that is available to you.

# Project 02 - Building a Student Intervention System

The goal of this project is to identify students who may need early intervention before being disapproved

# Project 03 - Creating Customer Segments

The task in this project is to use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers of a fictitious wholesale retailer, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories using various clustering techniques in order to help the retailer make more informed business decisions.

# Capstone - System to predict stock prices

* pandas_datareader
* arch_model

This project came from my interest in the financial market and the technical characteristics linked to the movements of assets (stocks). I have developed an application that will predict stock prices in a range of dates or on a specific date chosen for Brazilian stock market shares. The data used for analysis comes from historical data obtained by the system from specific providers for the collection of information via Phyton (eg yahoo, Google finance, and others) for each share. The user interacts with the system through a web application.
